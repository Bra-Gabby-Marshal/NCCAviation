			    <h2>REVIEW</h2>
                <p>This page provides a review section based on the technical specification of our avionics and aviaations.</p>			<br>
            
			    <h3>History of Avionics.</h3>
			    <p><b>"Avionics"</b> was invented in the year 1949 by Sir Philip Klass, who was the Snr. editor at <em>Aviation Week & Space Technology</em> maganiza as an <em>portmanteau</em> of <b>"aviation electronics"</b>.</p>
			    <p>Radio communication was first used in an aircraft poir to the <b>World War 1</b>. The first <b>airborne</b> were at <b>zeppelins</b>. but the military sparked development of light radio sets that 
			    could be carried by heavier-than-air craft, so that aerial reconnaissance biplanes could report their observations immediately in case they were shot down. The first experimental radio transmission from an 
			    airplane was conducted by the US Navy August 1910. The first aircraft radios transmitted by radio telegraphy, so they required two-seat aircraft with a second crewman to tap on a telegraph key to spell out 
			    messages by Morse code. During World War 1, AM voice two way radio sets were made possible in 1917 by the development of the triode vacuum tube, which were simple enough that the pilot in a single seat aircraft could use it while flying.<br>
			    </p><br>
             
			    <h3>The Modern avionics</h3>
			    <p>Avionics plays a vital role in the modernization initiatives like the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) to the next generation of Air Transportation System project in the United States and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative in Europe. The Joint Planning and Development Office brought about a roadmap for avionics in six areas:</p>
		        <p>1. Published Routes and Procedures – Improved navigation and routing.</p>
			    <p>2. Negotiated Trajectories – Adding data communications to create preferred routes dynamically.</p>
			    <p>3. Delegated Separation – Enhanced situational awareness in the air and on the ground.</p>
			    <p>4. Low Visibility/Ceiling Approach/Departure – Allowing operations with weather constraints with less ground infrastructure.</p>
			    <p>5. Surface Operations – To increase safety in approach and departure.</p>
			    <p>6. ATM Efficiencies – Improving the ATM process.</p><br> 
				
                <h3>The Helicopter Aircraft avionics.</h3>
			    <p>The cockpit of an aircraft is a typical location for avionic equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and anti-collision systems. The majority of aircraft power their avionics using 14- or 28‑volt DC electrical systems; however, larger, more sophisticated aircraft (such as airliners or military combat aircraft) have AC systems operating at 400 Hz, 115 volts AC.[9] There are several major vendors of flight avionics, including Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Honeywell (which now owns Bendix/King), Universal Avionics Systems Corporation, Rockwell Collins (now Collins Aerospace), Thales Group, GE Aviation Systems, Garmin, Raytheon, Parker Hannifin, UTC Aerospace Systems (now Collins Aerospace), Selex ES (now Leonardo S.p.A.), Shadin Avionics and Avidyne Corporation.</p>
						 
			    <h3>Communications.</h3>
			    <p>Communications connect the flight deck to the ground and the flight deck to the passengers. On‑board communications are provided by public-address systems and aircraft intercoms.
                The VHF aviation communication system works on the airband of 118.000 MHz to 136.975 MHz. Each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by 8.33 kHz in Europe, 25 kHz elsewhere. VHF is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-ATC. Amplitude modulation (AM) is used, and the conversation is performed in simplex mode. Aircraft communication can also take place using HF (especially for trans-oceanic flights) or satellite communication.</p>
						 
			    <h3>Navigation.</h3>
			    <p>Air navigation is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth. Avionics can use satellite navigation systems (such as GPS and WAAS), INS( inertial navigation system), ground-based radio navigation systems (such as VOR or LORAN), or any combination thereof. Some navigation systems such as GPS calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays. Older ground-based Navigation systems such as VOR or LORAN requires a pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on a paper map to determine an aircraft's location; modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays.</p>
						 
			    <h3>Monitoring.</h3>
			    <p>The first hints of glass cockpits emerged in the 1970s when flight-worthy cathode ray tube (CRT) screens began to replace electromechanical displays, gauges and instruments. A "glass" cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays. Aircraft were getting progressively more displays, dials and information dashboards that eventually competed for space and pilot attention. In the 1970s, the average aircraft had more than 100 cockpit instruments and controls. Glass cockpits started to come into being with the Gulfstream IV private jet in 1985. One of the key challenges in glass cockpits is to balance how much control is automated and how much the pilot should do manually. Generally they try to automate flight operations while keeping the pilot constantly informed.</p>
						 
			    <h3>Aircraft flight-control system.</h3>
			    <p>Aircraft have means of automatically controlling flight. Autopilot was first invented by Lawrence Sperry during World War I to fly bomber planes steady enough to hit accurate targets from 25,000 feet. When it was first adopted by the U.S. military, a Honeywell engineer sat in the back seat with bolt cutters to disconnect the autopilot in case of emergency. Nowadays most commercial planes are equipped with aircraft flight control systems in order to reduce pilot error and workload at landing or takeoff.
			    <br> The first simple commercial auto-pilots were used to control heading and altitude and had limited authority on things like thrust and flight control surfaces. In helicopters, auto-stabilization was used in a similar way. The first systems were electromechanical. The advent of fly by wire and electro-actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices that were electro-mechanical had a finite life. With safety critical systems, the software is very strictly tested.</p>
						 
			    <h3>Fuel Systems.</h3>
				<p>Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) monitors the amount of fuel aboard. Using various sensors, such as capacitance tubes, temperature sensors, densitometers & level sensors, the FQIS computer calculates the mass of fuel remaining on board.
                Fuel Control and Monitoring System (FCMS) reports fuel remaining on board in a similar manner, but, by controlling pumps & valves, also manages fuel transfers around various tanks.</p>   
				<p>1. Refuelling control to upload to a certain total mass of fuel and distribute it automatically.</p>	 
				<p>2. Transfers during flight to the tanks that feed the engines. E.G. from fuselage to wing tanks.</p> 
				<p>3. Centre of gravity control transfers from the tail (Trim) tanks forward to the wings as fuel is expended.</p> 
				<p>4. Maintaining fuel in the wing tips (to help stop the wings bending due to lift in flight) & transferring to the main tanks after landing.</p> 
				<p>5. Controlling fuel jettison during an emergency to reduce the aircraft weight.</p><br>
                   
                <h3>Collision-avoidance systems.</h3>
                <p>To supplement air traffic control, most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS), which can detect the location of nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the transponders of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution. To help avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), aircraft use systems such as ground-proximity warning systems (GPWS), which use radar altimeters as a key element. One of the major weaknesses of GPWS is the lack of "look-ahead" information, because it only provides altitude above terrain "look-down". In order to overcome this weakness, modern aircraft use a terrain awareness warning system (TAWS).</p>
 
                <h3>Flight recorders</h3>
                <p>Commercial aircraft cockpit data recorders, commonly known as "black boxes", store flight information and audio from the cockpit. They are often recovered from an aircraft after a crash to determine control settings and other parameters during the incident.</p>
				   
				<h3>Weather systems</h3>
				<p>Weather systems such as weather radar (typically Arinc 708 on commercial aircraft) and lightning detectors are important for aircraft flying at night or in instrument meteorological conditions, where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead. Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or severe turbulence (as sensed by lightning activity) are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas. Lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. In addition to radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as NEXRAD) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems. Modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, and traffic onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.
                           Modern weather systems also include wind shear and turbulence detection and terrain and traffic warning systems. In-plane weather avionics are especially popular in Africa, India, and other countries where air-travel is a growing market, but ground support is not as well developed.</p>
				   
				<h3>Aircraft management systems</h3>
				<p>There has been a progression towards centralized control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft, including engine monitoring and management. Health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) are integrated with aircraft management computers to give maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement. The integrated modular avionics concept proposes an integrated architecture with application software portable across an assembly of common hardware modules. It has been used in fourth generation jet fighters and the latest generation of airliners.</p>
