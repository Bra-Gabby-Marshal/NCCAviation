				<h3><u>Visual Flight(Aviation) Rules.</u></h3>
                <p><b>Visual flight rules</b> are the set of rules and regulations under how the pilots operates aircraft during weather conditions to allow the pilot see clear enough view of the aircraft is going. Ideally, weather conditions must be better than the basic VFR waether rules as outlined in the rules of aviation authority. Therefore, the pilot must be able to operat aircraft with visual references to the ground and by avoiding obstructions and other aircraft visually.</p> 
				<p>Whenever the weather is less than VMC, pilots are required to use flight rules instruments. VFR requires pilots to be able to view outside the cockpit, inorder to control the aircraft's altitude and also to aviod obstaclesand other aircraft. Established specific requirements for VFR flights include minimum visibility and distances from the clouds to make sure that aircrafts operating under VFR are visible from long distance to ensure safety.</p> 
				<p>VFR pilots are required to view and aviod obstacles and other aircrafts. Pilots flying under the VFR assumes the responsibility of their seperation from all other aircrafts and generally are not assigned routes by the air traffic control.Depending the category of the airspace in which the flight is been operated, VFR aircraft are benn required to have a transponder to help Air Traffic Control.</p> 
				<p>For pilots who don't have an instruments rating cannot legally fly by instrument flight rules, the restrictions of VMC minima can be troublesome in locations where weather conditions changes suddenly and when weather events are highly localized. For instance, a small cloud forming over the airport at less than 1000 feet technically requires the airport to allow only IFR flights using instrument approaches/departures. A VFR flight intending to land there would normally be denied clearance, and would either have to divert to another field with VMC, or declare an emergency and override the denial of clearance, which can prompt an inquiry and possibly result in adverse consequences for the pilot.</p><br>
                
				<h3><u>The Low flying rules</u></h3>
				<p><b>The Notwithstanding rule:</b> Though specific altitudes are called as noted below - there is an overreaching general requirement to maintain sufficient altitude that if a power unit fails, an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or property on the surface can be made. This may be significantly higher than 500ft or 1,000ft</p><br>
				<p><b>The 500 ft rule:</b> An aircraft must maintain an altitude of 500 feet above the surface, except over open water or sparsely populated areas. In those cases, the aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.</p><br>
				<p><b>The 1000 ft rule:</b> An aircraft must maintain an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons. Other aircraft, such as helicopters, powered parachutes, and weight-shift-control aircraft, are not required to meet the FAR 91 minimums, so long as their operation is conducted without hazard to persons or property on the surface.</p><br>
					
				<h3><u>Helicopter Performances and Operating Limitations.</u></h3>
                <h4>Explanation.</h4>
			    <p>1. <b>Cat A.</b> With respect to helicopters, a multi engined helicopters are designed with international airworthiness standards approved and adopted by CAA, and capable of operation using the take off and landing data scheduled under a critical engine failure concept which assures an adequate designated surface area and adequate performances capability for continued safe flight and a safe rejected take off.</p>						
			    <p>2. <b>Cat B.</b> With respect to helicopters,  a single engine or multi-engined helicopter which does not meet Cat A standards. Category B helicopters have no guaranteed capability to continue safe flight in the event of an engine failure, and a forced landing is assumed.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>The General rules.</h3>
				<p>1. Helicopters operating in  Classes 1 and 2 performance should be certificated in Category A.</p>
				<p>2. Helicopters operating in  Class 3 performance should be certificated in either a Category A or a Category B (or equivalent).</p>
				<p>3. Except as all permitted by the appropriate accredited authority.</p>
				<p>4. Take off or landing from or to heliports in a congested hostile environment should only be conducted in performance to Class 1.</p>
